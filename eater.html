                <h4>About the Project</h4>
                <p>In July of my summer internship at
                    <a class="pink link" href="https://www.voxmedia.com/a/vm" target="_blank">Vox Media Company</a>,
                    I moved to the Consumer Products team to help design a Progressive Web App for
                    <a class="pink link" href="https://www.eater.com/" target="_blank">Eater</a>,
                    one of Vox's eight media brands. The Eater App offers restaurant recommendations to users based on location, cuisine types, and overall interest. Unlike dining apps like Yelp, content for Eater comes from trusted Eater editors who are physically immersed in the world's greatest food cities.¬†I was tasked to create a new feature that will increase engagement and create more of a "food experience" within the app.¬†Working closely with other designers and engineers, I designed a <span class="bold">watchlist feature</span>, which allows users to create and share an assortment of personalized collections of restaurants.

                <h5 class="pink">Getting Started</h5>
                <h4>Understanding the Current Eater App</h4>
                <p>The Eater App (not yet launched) is a multi-surface product that helps users explore restaurants in their city and discover places to eat. The app currently consists of <span class="bold">3 tabs:</span></p>
                <img class="image" src="images/eater/current-screens.png" alt="current screens"/>
                <p class="caption">The 3 current pages</p>
                <h4 class="withoutH5">The Problem</h4>
                <p style="font-style: italic; opacity: .8; color: var(--gray-03); text-align: center; margin-bottom: -1vh;">"If you‚Äôre looking for good food recommendations, how often and for how long do you see yourself utilizing and engaging with this app?"¬†</p>
                <img class="image" src="images/eater/the-problem.png" alt="the problem"/>
                <p>By exploring the app and talking to potential users, I realized that users are limited to only cuisine and location explorations. They must enter the app knowing what they're in the mood for, which causes <span class="bold">(1) low engagement with the app (you must enter with a goal) as well as (2) a limited opportunity for exploring.</span></p>
            </div>

                    <li>How might we make this app more engaging?</li>
                    <li>How might we make this more of a mouth-watering experience?</li>

            <h4>Understanding our Users</h4>
            <p>
                On approaching this problem, it was important to gain a better grasp of how Eater users discover places to eat. We conducted 7 interviews with individuals who use Eater and had several conversations with casual Eater users. Our goals were to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand how users make dining decisions</li>
                <li>Discover the Eater elements that loyalists care most about (maps, news, individual writers, etc.)</li>
                <li>Uncover pain points and product opportunities</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="withoutH5">Affinity Diagram</h4>
            <p>
                I then began to map our observations from user interviews in order to pinpoint the underlying themes and trends from research. Using countless post-its, markers, and a whiteboard, I constructed the affinity diagram below.¬†As I presented this to my team, what really stood out to us was the fact that users open about 2-3 different apps (Notes, Maps, Google Sheets, etc.) from the time they research places they'd like to try to when they actually eat out.

            <p>
                Now that I brainstormed 3 potential features, I analyzed how each of the 3 foodies will use each feature.¬†This helped me understand which feature will be most impactful for the users.¬†

            <p>
                Next, I paired up each persona with a potential feature and went through user scenarios. The goal was to take these three feature ideas and create actual use-case scenarios on how foodies would iterate through the flow.

                <p>
                    I initially loved the travel guides feature, as it elevates the app to a worldly, aspirational experience that combines food and travel. After sketching out some initial ideas, I learned we are limited by Eater's content and what's available in the API. Since we can't create our own travel content, this travel experience might not be as valuable. 
                </p>
                <p class="quote2">
                    I realized that with these constraints, we might have to go back to the drawing board. You can‚Äôt fall in love with any idea because it may not be the best solution.

                    Thus, I decided to move forward with the <span class="bold" id="obsessive">WATCHLIST FEATURE</span> because:

                <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
                    <p style="margin-top: 1vh; margin-bottom: 1vh;">
                        <span class="number">1.</span>
                        It gives users something <span class="bold">actionable</span> to do, making it more of a tangible tool.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1vh; margin-bottom: 1vh;">
                        <span class="number">2.</span>
                        It can minimize the amount of apps users open use as they research restaurants.

                    <p style="margin-top: 1vh; margin-bottom: 1vh;">
                        <span class="number">3.</span>
                        It keeps the user <span class="bold">engaged</span> with the app beyond a simple restaurant search.      
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1vh; margin-bottom: 1vh;">
                        <span class="number">4.</span>
                        List-making is a natural output of the research and discovery activities of the app.

                Although different apps, Yelp and Instagram both have a fully-functioning "Collections" feature, where users can create their own unique lists/folders of photos (Instagram) and local businesses (Yelp). While analyzing how Yelp and Instagram execute their "Collections" feature, two things stood out to me that I wanted to emulate in Eater:
